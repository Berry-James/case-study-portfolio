## About The Project
Specialising in Marine equipment inspection and maintenance, 
our client, [Vertech Group](https://www.vertechgroup.com.au/) came to us with a (seemingly) simple request - to automate and digitise their inspection and reporting service.  Technicians are sent out to inspect various pieces of marine machinery (often on large oil rigs), and report back on the state of the item and suggest repairs if necessary.  This report is made accessible to onshore staff, who review and approve the report, before passing it to a representative from the machinery's maintainer.  A three step process, and one which would require three distinct web portals.
<br />

<a href={articleIndexHrefEnum.monorepo} />
## System Architecture
All three portals would share a design language, and a set of common components.  As such, it made perfect sense to take advantage of a monorepo service such as [NX](https://nx.dev/), a powerful monorepo build system with out of the box support for Next.JS, our front end framework of choice.  By using NX, we were able to share a host of components inside libs/shared/internal .
<br />

## Worksheet Templating Form
Vertech came to us with hundreds of different 'worksheets'; documents with fields ranging from simple one-line question/answers, to complex tables and multi selects.  Our task was to build a dynamic form which could be used to recreate these worksheets in a way our system could understand.
<br />

<ImgWrapper 
    src={ImgWorksheetTemplateModal} 
    caption={'A user can generate a template from scratch, or duplicate and build off an existing template.  This saved Vertech staff a heap of time, as many worksheets share common fields.'}
/>
<br />

<ImgWrapper 
    src={ImgWorksheetTemplate} 
    alt={'An example of a worksheet template'}
    caption={'An example of a worksheet template. The dropdown beside each field name is for selecting the field\'s type.'}
/>
<br />

[`React Hook Form`](https://react-hook-form.com/)

I chose react-hook-form as the form engine, as it is perfectly suited to building complex, dynamic forms.  It easily supports dynamic arrays of fields with the `useFieldArray` hook and schema management with yup, our chosen validation library.
<br />

[`Yup`](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

Support for complex form validation would be necessary, as validation rules would change depending on the type of field the user is trying to use.
For example, a simple short-text field only requires a name, whereas a table requires a name, column headers and a default number of rows.  Fortunately, yup's when method suits this use case perfectly.
<br />

<ArticleCodeBlock 
    code={
        `columns: yup.mixed().when('type', {
            is: 'table',
            then: () => yup.array(updateWorksheetTemplateColumnSchema),
            otherwise: (schema) => schema.nullable()
        })`
    }
/>
_An example of the when operator in `Yup`_
<br />

<ArticleCodeBlock 
    code={
       `options: yup.mixed().when('type', (type, schema) => {

            if(FIELDS_WITH_OPTIONS.includes(type[0])) {
                return yup
                .array(updateWorksheetTemplateFieldOptionSchema)
                .required('Options are required')
            }

            return schema.nullable()
        }
    )`
    }
/>
_A slightly more complex use case.  The first argument given to the callback is always an array, so we access it at index 0._
<br />

## Report Microservice

###### Architecture
Vertech requested their reports be generated in PDF format, so I undertook research into various PDF generation libraries, as well as which language would be most suitable for this service. I settled on Node.JS as the language and express as the framework, as I only needed a simple single-route service.
For the PDF package, I went with pdfkit as it exposes a very low-level API for position elements on the page as well as high-level callbacks to perform common actions, like inject content onto each page as they're created (think page numbers and headers).
<br />

###### Requirements
As the microservice operates entirely independently of the main Laravel backend, I would need to ensure it handled and returned any errors appropriately.  Furthermore, the service should always return a generated PDF, no matter how complex the data set.
<br />

###### Challenges
The biggest issue faced with PDF generation was the handling of images.  Technicians have the ability to upload and attach images to their worksheets (such as diagrams, schematics, or photos of damage to a piece of equipment).  Not knowing the dimensions of these images posed an interesting challenge:
1. I would have to ensure that there is enough space left on the page for the image to fit
2. The image would not exceed the available width on the page
3. The image's caption would not overflow
<br />

<ArticleCodeBlock 
    code={
        `// Determine the y coordinate where the next row starts.
        let rowStart = doc.y;

        // If we're too close to the bottom of the page
        // 1. Create a new page
        // 2. Update descriptions array (to indicate we've started a new page when rendering descriptions)
        // 3. Set row Start to top of page (plus allow space for header content etc)
        if(
            rowStart > 700 ||
            (row[0].type === 'file' && rowStart > 500) ||
            (row[0].type === 'files' && rowStart > 500)
        ) {
            doc.addPage();
            rowStart = PAGE.margin.top;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, move to rowStart
            doc.moveTo(doc.x, rowStart);
        }
        `
    }
/>
_If too close to the bottom of the page, add a new page and reset the rowStart variable.  Otherwise, move to rowStart._
